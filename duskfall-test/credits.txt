Edited UI/UX again is edited by me, because I'm lazy and I don't recall how to do said things in photoshop. I'm way past my prime for my HTML coding days, don't ask me how it works.

The UI/UX itself is from in game screenshots either by myself or just various websites.
These aren’t going to be credited because at the time of writing 7.1 maintenance is going on and I’m not able to log in and do my screenshots (Lies it’s two hours from now I’m just lazy.) 

This is in reference to the fact the FF7 style one we found didn’t work right for NPF, and we. Were determined to make our own :D.
